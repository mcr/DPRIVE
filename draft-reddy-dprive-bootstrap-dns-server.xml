      <t>This document specifies mechanisms to automatically bootstrap
      endpoints (e.g., hosts, Customer Equipment) to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by a local

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>Various network security services are provided by Enterprise, secure
      home and wall-gardened networks to protect endpoints (e.g,. hosts, IoT
      devices). Some of these security services act on DNS requests from
      endpoints. However, if an endpoint is configured to use public
      DNS-over-(D)TLS <xref target="RFC7858"></xref> <xref
      target="RFC8094"></xref> or DNS-over-HTTPS <xref
      target="RFC8484"></xref> servers, network security services in the local
      network cannot act efficiently on DNS requests from the endpoints. In
      order to act on DNS requests from endpoints, network security services
      can block DNS-over-(D)TLS traffic by dropping outgoing packets to
      destination port 853, and by identifying the domains offering
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers, DNS-over-HTTPS traffic can be blocked by
      dropping outgoing packets to these domains. If the endpoint has enabled
      strict privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref target="RFC8310"></xref>),
      and the network security service blocks the traffic to the public DNS
      server, DNS service is not available to the endpoint and ultimately the
      endpoint cannot access Internet. If the endpoint has enabled
      opportunistic privacy profile (Section 5 of <xref
      target="RFC8310"></xref>), and the network security service blocks
      traffic to the public DNS server, the endpoint will either fallback to
      an encrypted connection without authenticating the DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network or fallback to
      clear text DNS, and cannot exchange encrypted DNS messages. This can
      compromise the endpoint security and privacy; some of the potential
      security threats are listed below:</t>

      <t><list style="symbols">
          <t>Pervasive monitoring of DNS traffic.</t>

          <t>If the endpoint is an IoT device which is configured to use
          public DNS-over-(D)TLS or DNS-over-HTTPS servers, and if a policy
          enforcement point in the local network is programmed using a
          Manufacturer Usage Description (MUD) file <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref> by a MUD manager to only allow
          intented communications to and from the IoT device, the policy
          enforcement point cannot enforce the Network Access Control List
          rules based on domain names (Section 8 of <xref
          target="I-D.ietf-opsawg-mud"></xref>).</t>

          <t>The network security service cannot prevent an endpoint from
          accessing malicious domains. Attacks like DNS cache poisoning can
          lead the user to visit malicious website to inject malware on the
          endpoint. For instance, malwares like DNSChanger can modify the
          endpoint's DNS entries to point toward its own rogue name servers
          which then injected its own advertising into Web pages.</t>
        </list></t>

      <t>The DPRIVE and DoH working groups have not defined an automated
      mechanism to securely bootstrap the endpoints to discover and
      authenticate DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS servers in the local
      network. Some clients have pre-configured specific public DNS servers
      (such as Mozilla using Cloudflare's DNS-over-HTTPS server). If endpoints
      continue to use hard-coded public DNS servers, this has a risk of
      relying on few centralized DNS services. Further, Content Delivery
      Networks (CDNs) that map traffic based on DNS may lose the ability to
      direct end-user traffic to a nearby cluster in cases where a DNS service
      is being used that is not affiliated with the local network and which
      does not send "EDNS Client Subnet" (ECS) information to the CDN's DNS
      authorities <xref target="CDN"></xref>.</t>

      <t>The document proposes a mechanism to automatically bootstrap the
      endpoints to discover and authenticate the DNS-over-(D)TLS and
      DNS-over-HTTPS servers provided by the local network. The overall
      procedure can be structured into the following steps:<list
          style="symbols">
          <t>Bootstrapping phase (<xref target="bootstrap-iot"></xref> and
          <xref target="bootstrap-endpoint"> </xref>) is meant to
          automatically to automatically bootstrap endpoints with local
          network's CA certificates and DNS server certificate.</t>

          <t>Discovery phase (<xref target="discovery"></xref>) is meant to
          discover an authentication domain (defined in <xref
          target="RFC8310"></xref>) to authenticate the privacy-enabling DNS
          server, the privacy-enabling protocols supported by the DNS server
          and usable DNS server IP addresses. </t>

          <t>Connection handshake and service invocation: The DNS client
          initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server learned in the
          discovery phase. Furthermore, DNS client uses the credentials
          discovered during the bootstrapping phase to validate the server
          certificate.</t>

    <section anchor="discovery" title="Discovery Procedure">
      <t>A DNS client discovers the DNS server in the local network supporting

          <t>The DNS client uses DHCP to discover the authentication domain
          name for the DNS server, as specified in <xref
          target="dhcp"></xref>.</t>

          <t>The DNS client then uses S-NAPTR <xref target="RFC3958"></xref>
          lookup to learn the protocols DNS-over-TLS, DNS-over-DTLS, and
          DNS-over-HTTPS supported by the DNS server and the DNS privacy
          protocol preferred by the DNS server administrators, as specified in
          <xref target="srvr"></xref> and <xref target="serviceT"> </xref>. If
          DNS-over-HTTPS protocol is supported by the DNS server, the DNS
          client queries for the URI resource record type <xref
          target="RFC7553"></xref> to use the https URI scheme (Section 3 of
          <xref target="RFC8484"></xref>). </t>

          <t>The DNS client initiates (D)TLS handshake with the DNS server,
          the server presents its certificate and the client validates the
          server certificate using the End-Entity certificate and Explicit
          Trust Anchor database downloaded in steps 3 and 4 in <xref
          target="bootstrap-iot"></xref> and <xref
          target="bootstrap-endpoint"></xref>. The DNS client uses validation
          techniques as described in <xref target="RFC6125"></xref> to compare
          the authentication domain name to the certificate provided by the
          DNS server.</t>

          <t>If the DNS client cannot reach or establish an authenticated and
          encrypted connection with the privacy-enabling DNS server provided
          by the local network, the DNS client can fallback to the
          privacy-enabling public DNS server.</t>

        retrying a lookup that has failed, a DNS client MUST wait a time
        period that is appropriate for the encountered error (e.g., NXDOMAIN,
        timeout, etc.).</t>

    <section anchor="Security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>The bootstrapping procedure to discover and authenticate
      DNS-over-(D)TLS and DNS-over-HTTPS Servers MUST be enabled by the
      endpoint in a trusted network (e.g. Enterprise, Secure home networks)
      and disabled in a untrusted network (e.g. public WiFi network), similar
      to the way VPN connection from the endpoint to a VPN gateway is
      disconnected in a trusted network and VPN connection is established in a
      untrusted network. </t>

      <t>If the endpoint has enabled strict privacy profile, and the network
      security service blocks the traffic to the privacy-enabling public DNS
      server, a hard failure occurs and the user is notified. The user has a
      choice to switch to another network or if the user trusts the network,
      the user can enable strict privacy profile with the DNS-over-(D)TLS or
      DNS-over-HTTPS server discovered in the network instead of downgrading
      to opportunistic privacy profile. </t>

      <t>The primary attack against the methods described in <xref
      target="discovery"></xref> is one that would lead to impersonation of a
      DNS server. An attacker could attempt to compromise the DHCP discovery
      and S-NAPTR resolution. The attack is prevented by validating the
      certificate presented by the DNS server. DHCP-related security
      considerations are discussed in <xref target="RFC2131"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC8415"></xref>.</t>

      <t>Security considerations in <xref
      target="I-D.ietf-anima-bootstrapping-keyinfra"></xref> and <xref
      target="RFC7804"></xref> need to be taken into consideration.</t>
